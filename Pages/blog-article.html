          Attending a trade show can be a very effective method of promoting
          your company and its products. And one of the most effective ways to
          optimize your trade show display and increase traffic to your booth is
          through the use of banner stands.

          Last month, my wife, Anne Doe, took me to Las Vegas because she had to
          go for a business convention. Needless to say, she writes for an guide
          to casinos and I hate gambling. But then, she likes it and this
          supports us too, so I went along without any hassle. At first I was
          depressed, but then as I asked around and looked around, I ended up
          having more fun in Las Vegas than I would have thought. And no. I did
          not enter a single casino while I was there.

          One of the greatest things about Las Vegas, Reno and Atlantic City
          (but especially Las Vegas) is the number of shows that are available.
          You can get to watch top class comedians like Jay Leno, Jerry
          Seinfeld, Ray Romano, Tim Allen and even the likes of Bill Cosby and
          Chris Rock. If you are into music you can watch female singers like
          Celine Dion, Mariah Carey, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera and
          Beyonc?, male performers like Phil Collins, Eric Clapton, Snoopy Dog
          and bands like Oasis and Bon Jovi. I could go on and on but the list
          is endless. If you are into magic you can watch magicians like David
          Copperfield do their thing meters from you. Whatever you like, you can
          find it here from Western music to oldies to Jazz, Rock, Heavy Mettle
          to Trance. All you have to do is look at the itenary offered during
          your visit.
        </p>
        <h5 class="bold">Food</h5>
        <p class="text-muted bold my-3">
          Chinese to Japanese to Korean to Jewish and even Vegetarian and proper
          meat eating establishments await your every delight in Vegas. Do not
          opt for the cheap and oily fried dishes served for free while you
          play. Stop a while and take in the delightful scenery and smells of
          East Asian or European dishes. What is wondrous is that you get to see
          man’s ability to mix. A real melting pot if I may say so myself.

          But is that all what casino cities like Las Vegas are about? Do you
          have to remain in the city to really and truly enjoy your stay? No.

        <h3 class="bold">
          Here are some of the better attractions you must see on your visit to
          Vegas:
        </h3>
        <p class="text-muted bold my-3">
          Hoover Dam and the Grand Canyon: Book yourself a seat on any of the
          many sightseeing tours available and go and watch the architectural
          marvel that is Hoover Dam built over the Grand canyon which is also a
          grand sight to see by itself. Black Canyon is another must see as is
          Lake Mead which is so beautiful just because it is a body of water all
          surrounded by desert-like nature. Colorado River: <br /><br />
        </p>

        <p class="bold text-muted">
          While looking at the Dam and Canyon is from above, to see the true
          beauty of the river, you have to go down. The Colorado river is
          excellent for river-rafting and water sports, but you do not have to
          take part if it is not your thing. Instead just sit back and enjoy
          another of nature’s marvels.

          Who can not resist going to one of the old towns like those in the
          Western gun slinging movies? Your destination needs to be Old Nevada.
          There you can delight in an old western town right in the middle of
          Red Rock Canyon. They host western shootouts too so come prepared,
          partner! I could go on and on about other attractions like the theme
          park in Circus Circus, the Gilcrease Nature Sanctuary, the Henderson
          Bird Viewing Preserve and Mt. Charleston but I think you get the
          picture. In Las Vegas and hate gambling? Do not despair. Just go out
          and have some clean un-gambling fun.
        </p>

            Many people would say that it is absolute madness to keep on doing
            the same thing, time after time, expecting to get a different result
            or for something different to happen.
